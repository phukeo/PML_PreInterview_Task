# Bokeh Library Demonstrator 

## This was the interview task set for my role at PML 

#### Reference Site: Western Channel Observatory <br> Coastal Station: L4 <br> Instrument: CTD 

The aim of this jupyter notebook/html is to visualise data from the WCO, L4, CTD in-situ time series data file using the bokeh library. It shows you how to build bokeh plots and also export the html which is suitable for web stuff and also free standing demonstrators. 
<br>
A CTD instrument is used to take measurements of several variables over depth for the study of seasonal and
annual trends. <br>
A link to the data used in this notebook is provided [HERE](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nz2xotqglirl0wy/L4_CTDf_ODV_format.txt?dl=0)

A smaller data file `L4_CTDf_ODV_formatSmall.txt` has been added to the repo with only 2500 to reduce lag in the plots. Just change the cell below the Data Wrangling - Data Import cell.
